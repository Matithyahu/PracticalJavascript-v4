# PracticalJavascript-v4

Practical Javascript is a learning-by-doing course. I'll be commiting my
progress to git repositories.

Started Version 4 of the learning app on June 6th, 2017.

Completed Version 4 on June 11th

Added feature in the displayTodos function that shows an asterisk in from
of a todo with a completed status of false and an "x" in front of a todo with
a completed status of true.
